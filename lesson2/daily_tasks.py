# As you go through routine tasks over the next few days, think through and define algorithms for those tasks. Consider writing the steps out for the following tasks:
# Tie shoes
# Load a dishwasher
# Make a bed
# Create a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
# How would you write the steps for these tasks for a computer? Write the steps and see if another person can follow them exactly as they are written.
